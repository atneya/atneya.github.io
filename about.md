I'm Atneya Nair, a software developer interested in low-level code with a preference for C++. 
I have a passion for sharing and consuming ideas. This is one of the main reasons I have for starting a [blog]({% post_url 2021-05-18-on-blogging %}).
I have also given a [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY9BrS2uX-c), 
and hope to give many more in the future.


I graduated from Georgia Tech with a double major in CS and Math in 2021. 
While I enjoy coding, one of the primary things that drew me to software engineering is the availability
of interesting things to learn in both the downwards and sidewards directions.
Through my coursework I noticed that while most of the courses in which I enjoyed *doing* were CS courses,
most of the courses in which I enjoyed *learning* were Math courses (a fact reflected in the icon 
[choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane) for my website):

I am a big fan of games (mathematical, video-, card-, and board-) and public radio. 

I try to open source most of my code (including the source for this [website](https://github.com/atneya/atneya.github.io)) on my [GitHub](https://github.com/atneya).
If you are interested in my professional history, take a look at my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/atneya).

Right now I'm working on two projects which I am not yet ready to share involving mechanical keyboards and poker (two of my hobbies).
As they progress I plan to share more on this site and GitHub.

If you are interested in contacting me, the best way is through my personal email, available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/atneya) profile. Feedback is welcome!
